# telegram-stats-time-that-person-wrote-messages-number-of-message-from-period-of-time
This small scrips calculate time that person wrote u a message, and counts messages from a period of time. Now ( ver 1.0 ) it works only with c++ compiler, on VScode.
u should export chat history with one file ( by default result.json ) and put at the same folder with this script, then it ask u person, if nickname of person have some spaces u can replace them with "-" ( for exmp "Some Nick Name" = "Some-Nick-Name") , and after that this script created a file "stats.txt" which u can read and get this stats


For windows there isn't any good solution, coz u need to install others program, but i have one, so to run this file u need to sign up in a replit.io, and create project on a C++ language, then copy code and paste to programme, and upload json file from telegram
